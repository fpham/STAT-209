  t.production_year -- choose production_year column from "title" table which we later join
FROM cast_info as ci -- ci for short of cast_info
JOIN name as n ON ci.person_id = n.id -- equals cast_info %>% inner_join(name, by = c("id" = "id"))

-- to get the name

JOIN title as t ON ci.movie_id = t.id -- equals %>% inner_join(title, by = c("id" = "id"))

-- to get the movie title

LEFT JOIN char_name as cn ON ci.person_role_id = cn.id 
WHERE ci.person_id = 2977372 -- Viola Davisâ€™s id
  AND t.kind_id = 1 -- to return movies? kind_id are mostly 7 but I do not quite understand how this returns movie. In the previous exercise, I let it equal 7 but I consulted your sample solution.
  
ORDER BY production_year ASC -- Sort production_year column by ascending order

LIMIT 0,100; -- ALWAYS the last thing in the query. Is there a way to use is.na() function?
