## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

housing <- read_csv("http://colindawson.net/data/landdata-states.csv")
glimpse(housing)

hp2013Q1 <- housing %>% filter(Date == 2013.25)

## Base plot

base_plot <- ggplot(hp2013Q1, aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = Land.Value)) 

base_plot <- base_plot + geom_point()

base_plot <- base_plot + aes(color = Home.Value)

base_plot <- base_plot + geom_point(aes(shape = region))

base_plot

home_value_plot <- ggplot(hp2013Q1, aes(y = Home.Value, x = Land.Value)) +
  geom_point()
home_value_plot <- home_value_plot + aes(color = Structure.Cost) + geom_point()

home_value_plot

home_line_plot <- base_plot + geom_point() + geom_line()

home_line_plot

home_smooth_plot <- base_plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

home_smooth_plot

home_plot <- ggplot(housing, aes(y = State, x = Home.Price.Index)) + geom_point(aes(color = Date), alpha = 0.3, size = 1.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.25))
home_plot <- home_plot + scale_y_discrete(name = "State Abbreviation")
home_plot <- home_plot + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1), linetype = 3, color = "black") + scale_color_gradient2(breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25), labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013), low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "gray60", midpoint = 1994.25)

home_plot

state_plot <- ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value))

state_plot <- state_plot + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 10)

state_plot

price_plot <- ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Price.Index))

price_plot <- price_plot + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 10)

price_plot

```

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
